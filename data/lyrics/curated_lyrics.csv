What the hell, I didn't smoke a year,  I'm not tired of you, I didn't have a pleasant smell,  Not in July, with a sweet,  Warm sea breeze at night,  And the shanty-shanty on the dawn with a thick grove.  Who are you?  Your words, whose depth is the black?"

The young guy is now completely captured by secondary signs.  The principle of apologist, the dirt itself, the one who strived for it.  The very bottom, only if not conformism.  In the crowd I decided to be superfluous, only not like everyone.  As a result, I put my teeth three times.  Once I almost sat down, got completely tangled in the pond."
108494,"And even in the puddle I sat down, I knew I would rise again, I believed in a miracle  I prayed for you, I did not retreat, although I did not seek battles  I lived thanks to you, to those who were always by my side  Yes, the blessing of fate is your good deeds  And wherever the road leads me, as if I know, you will be glad  I would be tired of this traveler in all days, and the wind of the clouds drove me out  So our life goes up and down, up and down  Who is on a dirty cornice?

I can't breathe, be away from the cliché, I want,  But the feelings are collapsing and I run at night.  Our mind is like our mind is sometimes our enemy.  In a moment of weakness, they ask to let go where the bridges burn.  In history, there is a light of moments of tenderness,  And we both had to carry a sharp knife in our palms.  I held the spell stronger than you for the handle."
